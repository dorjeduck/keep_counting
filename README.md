#  Keep Counting - a basic Flutter Foreground Service Demo App

## Introduction
This project is a demonstration Flutter application showcasing the basic usage of the  [`flutter_foreground_task`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_foreground_task) package. Its primary focus is to exemplify the implementation of bidirectional communication between the main app and a foreground service.

The project is intended to serve as a foundation for discussion and learning within the Flutter community. Please note that this is an initial release and not yet a mature implementation. As such, it should be considered a conceptual example rather than a ready-to-use template for your own applications.

## Features
- Demonstrates how to implement and manage foreground tasks in a Flutter app.
- Utilizes the  [`flutter_foreground_task`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_foreground_task) package for robust foreground service handling.
- Showcases how to setup the communication between the main app and the foreground service.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and run the following commands:
```bash
