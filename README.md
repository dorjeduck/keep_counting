#  Keep Counting - a basic Flutter Foreground Service Demo App (Android)

## Introduction
This project is a demonstration Flutter application showcasing the basic usage of the  [`flutter_foreground_task`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_foreground_task) plugin. Its primary focus is to exemplify the implementation of bidirectional communication between the main app and a foreground service.

The project is intended to serve as a foundation for discussion and learning within the Flutter community. Please note that this is an initial release and not yet a mature implementation. As such, it should be considered a conceptual example rather than a ready-to-use template for your own applications.

## Features
- Demonstrates how to implement and manage foreground tasks in a Flutter app.
- Utilizes the  [`flutter_foreground_task`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_foreground_task) plugin for robust foreground service handling.
- Showcases how to setup the communication between the main app and the foreground service.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and run the following commands:
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Usage
This demo application showcases a foreground service implementation using Flutter. It features an interactive counter that continuously operates as a foreground service, ensuring uninterrupted functionality even when the app is minimized or running in the background on your device.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. Here are some ways you can contribute:
